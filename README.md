#Challenge Framework

Basic JavaScript programming challenge validation, for educational purposes.

##Key Features

* A whitelist of specific functionality. Example: If a for loop is on the whitelist, then code will not pass unless it contains a for loop
* A blacklist of specific functionality. Example: If while loops were in the blacklist, then the code will error if a while loop is included.
* Rough structure of program. Example: If an if statement inside a for loop is required, then code that contains just one or the other, or both but not in the proper structure, will not pass.
